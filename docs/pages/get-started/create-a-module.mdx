# Create a module

A module, called _airModule_ in our system, is technically a web application with specific requirements that will be embedded through an Iframe.

For correct integration with the ecosystem all the modules, independent of the technology and frameworks that are decided to use, must have the existence of an `index.html` file, a `setup.json` file and the use of the **Registry Script** library. In addition to this, you must have the **Registry CLI** package installed, which will allow you to interact with the ecosystem: create, deploy and promote the modules.

All modules must also have non-functional requirements associated mostly with performance or security.

To create your first module using the **Developer Hub** you have two useful shortcuts that will help you quickly acclimate to the ecosystem:

- **Tutorial**: Follow our getting started tutorial step by step (using React).
- **Examples**: Clone any of our examples from the most basic _hello tech_, or those specialized in areas to the complete demo modules.
