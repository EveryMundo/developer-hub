**Playground** is a preview tool on a sandbox environment that enables the development and QA of a Registry airModule. This tool creates a module payload (input config for the airModule) with mock data using the configuration specified in the [**Setup JSON**](/learning/setup-file).

The tool is divided into two main areas:

- **Module Preview**: The preview of the module that is being reviewed.
- **Configuration UI**: The UI to manage and test the module. This last area can be minified to better display the module preview.

The **Module Preview** shows how the module responds to the combinations that have been selected in the **Configuration UI**. The only input that the module receives is called _Module Payload_ and its exact value can be checked in the **Configuration UI**.

## Tabs

### Overview

The overview tab shows the details of the module displayed. 

- **Module URL 

- **Setup.JSON URL used for the module rendering

- **Viewport - adjustable settings to render the module based on changing  viewports

- **Template - render the module in various positions within a page

- **Context - the context of the module currently rendered. The context can be changed, by Editing the Module Payload

#### Module Payload

The Module Payload, displays the payload used to render the module. This is the information defined within the Setup.JSON. 

The Module Payload can be edited, to adjust the module context and details, in order to change the module rendering based on changing Module Payloads.

### Settings

The Settings tab allows configuring the module, using the available configuration available for the modules. For example, if a module allows adjusting the filters within the module, those settings can be set within the Settings tab, to test the module based on changing configurations.

### Test

The Test Tab can be used to render the module just as it will appear on a live airTRFX page. 

This includes any page of a valid tenant, site edition, page slug, and defined theme. 

The user can either manually enter test scenarios, or upload a JSON file, to populate pre-set scenarios. 

*The test scenarios parameters are case sensitive*

### Logs

This tab can be used to troubleshoot and get visibility over the API calls used to load data.
