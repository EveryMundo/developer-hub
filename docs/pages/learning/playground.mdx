**Playground** is a preview tool on a sandbox environment that enables the development and QA of a Registry airModule. This tool creates a module payload (input config for the airModule) with mock data using the configuration specified in the [**Setup JSON**](/learning/setup-file).

The tool is divided into two main areas:

- **Module Preview**: The preview of the module that is being reviewed.
- **Configuration UI**: The UI to manage and test the module. This last area can be minified to better display the module preview.

The **Module Preview** shows how the module responds to the combinations that have been selected in the **Configuration UI**. The only input that the module receives is called _Module Payload_ and its exact value can be checked in the **Configuration UI**.

## Tabs

### Overview

The overview tab shows the details of the module displayed. 

- **Module URL**

- **Setup.JSON URL** used for the module settings and rendering

- **Viewport** render the module based on changing viewports

- **Template** preview the module as it will appear in different positions within a page

- **Context** the context of the module currently rendered. The context can be changed, by Editing the Module Payload

#### Module Payload

The Module Payload, displays the payload used to render the module. This is the information defined within the Setup.JSON. 

The Module Payload can be edited, to adjust the module context and details, in order to change the module rendering based on changing Module Payloads.

#### Settings

The Settings tab allows configuring the module, using the available configuration available for the modules. For example, if a module allows adjusting the filters within the module, those settings can be set within the Settings tab, to test the module based on changing configurations.

### Test

The Test tab enables users to preview how an airModule will appear under different rendering conditions such as Tenant Code, Site-edition, Slug, and Theme ID. 

The user can either manually enter test scenarios on the UI, or upload a JSON file with a bulk of preset scenarios, a template file can be found for download within the Test Tab. 

*The test scenarios parameters are case sensitive*
