**Editor** is a tool from the **EveryMundo Developer Hub** that accelerates the construction of the digital contract [**Setup.json**](/learning/setup-file) without the need for the module to be developed yet.

**Editor** is something like a small development IDE for building Setup Json with auto-completion and validation functionalities.

**Editor** also generates two very useful elements to conceive the module from the beginning:

- UIs that are displayed at different levels of the roles involved in the system, ex: settings, styles, i18n, ...

- A realistic sample of _Module Payload_.
