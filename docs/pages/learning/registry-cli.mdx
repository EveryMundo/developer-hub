**Registry CLI** allows a Partner to upload and synchronize a module (previously tested in a local environment) to our platform. It follows good practices carried out by important platforms such as [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). So, the workflow can be easily recognized by a developer. It has a configuration file like [vercel.json](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-configuration) or [netlify.toml](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/)
