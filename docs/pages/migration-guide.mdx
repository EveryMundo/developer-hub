# Migration Guide

![Migration Guide Cover](@/assets/images/migration-guide/cover.jpg)

## Get Started / Knowing this "mamotreto"

This is a detailed guide to accelerate the migration of existing _PROS modules_ to the **Developer Hub Ecosystem**.
It serves as a complement to other tools for organizing internal processes.

It will be useful as long as the modules meet these conditions:

- The module is already **working in production**. 
- The module **currently uses our services** (although not necessarily the latest versions) 
- The module already **use labels defined in the system**. 
- The module has **required settings** to be functional and flexible according to our needs.
- The module has **styling mechanisms that apply Design System** (formerly _EDS_) even if it is not directly connected to tokens. 
- The module **use our tracking services**.

In-depth information can be found in specialized sections of the documentation

<Callout>
  In this guide, **Developer Hub** and **Registry** are used to refer to the same concept.

### Good to know

Lorem ipsum lorem

## Key concepts

### What is a Developer Hub Module?

A _Developer Hub Module_ must be a quality app that meets the standards and market needs associated with the functional and non-functional requirements provided by PROS.

However, at a more basic technical level, we can summarize that a app becomes a _Developer Hub Module_ if it meets the following:

- The app is a **web application with an `index.html` in the root of the build** folder.
- There should be a **`setup.json` file in the root of the build** folder 
- The project must **install and use `@everymundo/registry-script`** dependency

### Setup.json and Module Payload

### Registry Script (`@everymundo/registry-script`)

### Development, testing and deployment tools.

### Internal concepts

In addition to the previous concepts, you should also know about terms such as _Context_, how to use our _Services/Apis_, details about the Design System (formerly _EDS_), specific events of the _Tracking Library_, etc. etc.

## Things we already have / Things we need.

- A module working in production
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Wrap it in an app with the specifications of a _Developer Hub module_.
  - [ ] Deploy to the _PROS_ ecosystem of the **Developer Hub** using _Registry CLI_
  - [ ] Add new events to request the module in "fullscreen" or trigger the "Popup"
- A module currently using our services
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Add in the `setup.json` the services configuration and include all the services used by the module according to the convention
  - [ ] Migrate services to what we call _Smart Services_.
- A module using labels defined in the system
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Make an inventory of all the label keys used by the Module.
  - [ ] Add the i18n configuration to `setup.json` and include all the labels keys that the module has with their respective values ​​in English.
- A module using **required settings** to be functional and flexible
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Add to `setup.json` the configuration to use custom settings
  - [ ] Define the structure of the module settings using the generic settings templates provided
  - [ ] Connect the new settings values ​​received through the _Module Payload_ with the way the module internally handles the settings.
- A module using styling mechanisms that apply Design System (formerly EDS)
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Add to `setup.json` the configuration to use _Design System_ style tokens.
  - [ ] Make the necessary mapping transformations between the received _Design System_ tokens and the internal token structure used by the module.
- A module using our tracking services
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Migrate to the new module tracking library.

## Straight to the point

<Steps>

### Obtaining credentials

Before being able to interact with the platform you need to have available certain credentials necessary to deploy the module and also to interact with the services/apis.

- Registry CLI credentials (user, key).
- Services/Apis token.

<Callout>
  There is no reason to stop if you do not yet have the final Registry CLI credentials. You can advance in everything else except what is related to module deployment/promotion.
</Callout>

### Wrap module in a Registry module



```bash
npx degit Everymundo/developer-hub/examples/hello-react your-project-folder-name
```

#### Project structure

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="hello-react/" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public/" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="setup.json" active />
      <FileTree.File name="..." />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src/" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="components/" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="App/" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="App.css" />
          <FileTree.File name="App.jsx" active />
          <FileTree.File name="index.js" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="Button/" />
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="context/" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="hooks/" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="styles/" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="utils/" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.js" active />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="package.json" active />
    <FileTree.File name="..." />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Setup.json and Module Payload in practice

Setup.json example:

```json
{
  "context": {},
  "settings": {
    "schema": {
      "properties": {}
    }
  },
  "styles": {
    "service": "codeless",
    "options": {
      "type": "eds",
      "format": "json"
    }
  },
  "i18n": {
    "rtl": true,
    "language": "*",
    "labels": {
      "label-key-1": "English value for key 1",
      "label-key-2": "English value for key 2"
    }
  },
  "tokens": {
    "em:apiKey": "<some-very-very-secret-token>"
  },
  "services": {
    "some-unique-and-well-known-key": {
      "endpoint": "https://services-url/path-to-services"
    },
    "em:sputnik:search": {
      "endpoint": "https://openair-dev.airtrfx.com/airfare-sputnik-service/v3/%%tenantCode%%/fares/search"
    }
  },
  "metaData": {}
}
```

Payload example

```json
{}
```

### Using Registry Script in `index.js`.

(Add demo code)

### Special events: "Fullscreen" and "Popup".

(Explanation of the new event names and how to use them with promises.)

### Settings definition (Form)

(References to the Json Schema documentation, settings and links to the specific templates for the pricing modules. Also give an example of the partner module in the playground and Editor.)

### Consuming EDS

(Describe where the tokens are received, the structure of the object, how to print the sources and list of all the tokens.)

### I18N / Label Translation

(Brief description of some attributes of i18n and how to extract the module labels.)

### Migration of Services/APIS

(How services are defined in Setup.json and how to migrate to new versions.)

### Tracking library

(Link to the tracking library.)

### Deploy new module using Registry CLI
