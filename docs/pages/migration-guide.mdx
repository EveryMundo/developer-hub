# Migration Guide

![Migration Guide Cover](@/assets/images/migration-guide/cover.jpg)

## Get Started / Knowing this "mamotreto"

This is a detailed guide to accelerate the migration of existing _PROS modules_ to the **Developer Hub Ecosystem**.
It serves as a complement to other tools for organizing internal processes.

It will be useful as long as the modules meet these conditions:

- The module is already **working in production**. 
- The module **currently uses our services** (although not necessarily the latest versions) 
- The module already **use labels defined in the system**. 
- The module has **required settings** to be functional and flexible according to our needs.
- The module has **styling mechanisms that apply Design System** (formerly _EDS_) even if it is not directly connected to tokens. 
- The module **use our tracking services**.

In-depth information can be found in specialized sections of the documentation

<Callout>
  In this guide, **Developer Hub** and **Registry** are used to refer to the same concept.
</Callout>

### Good to know

- If you have more questions that cannot be resolved with this guide or this documentation site, please get in touch. We will resolve your doubt by expanding/improving this documentation.
- If you find any typographical errors, or have suggestions for changes to the documentation, you can manage them directly by editing the pages and making a Pull Request. This documentation is in a public repository.

## Key concepts

### Architecture

_Developer Hub Modules_ (for now) load inside an Iframe on the client page. Broadly speaking, the elements described below are key in the workflow.
- _Adnetify Script_
- _Module Manager_
- _Registry Script_

![Adnetify](@/assets/images/learning/architecture-adnetify.png)

#### Adnetify Script

_Adnetify Script_ is a code that is delivered to the client and is responsible for scanning the entire page and detecting assigned spaces (slots) to place modules and other significant information such as the client's URL, data layers, etc. _Adnetify Script_ communicates with a service in the backend called _Module Manager_ who is responsible for determining based on the information obtained by Adnetify Script which modules should be loaded in each slot found on the client page. To load the module, _Adnetify Script_ also has another important task: communication with a script that lives inside the module called _Registry Script_.

#### Module Manager

_Module Manager_ is the brain in the entire process of putting a module live to the client. It is a group of services that are consumed by _Adnetify Script_.

#### Registry Script

_Registry Script_ is the only concept mentioned in this section that will be directly used in the development of the module. It is a library that you must have as a dependency in your project.

This library is the one that communicates with _Adnetify Script_ to obtain the module startup data, which we call _Module Payload_.

It also takes care of other extra tasks such as adapting the Iframe to the dimensions of the module, opening the module in full size, triggering the popup, etc. etc.

### What is a Developer Hub Module?

A _Developer Hub Module_ must be a quality app that meets the standards and market needs associated with the functional and non-functional requirements provided by PROS.

However, at a more basic technical level, we can summarize that a app becomes a _Developer Hub Module_ if it meets the following:

- The app is a **web application with an `index.html` in the root of the build** folder.
- There should be a **`setup.json` file in the root of the build** folder 
- The project must **install and use `@everymundo/registry-script`** dependency

### Setup.json and Module Payload

**Setup.json**: A configuration file `setup.json` that be uploaded with the project build. Is a JSON file that acts as a vital contract between the module and the system. It technically describes module settings, integration with the design system, label definitions, API usage, resource permissions, (...)

**Module Payload**: An object that will contain all the values ​​that are needed to run the module. For example, the context, settings, Design System tokens, labels, etc. This object is returned by the Registry Script library.

### Development, testing and deployment tools.

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Registry CLI**
      </td>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Internal concepts

In addition to the previous concepts, you should also know about terms such as _Context_, how to use our _Services/Apis_, details about the Design System (formerly _EDS_), specific events of the _Tracking Library_, etc. etc.

## Things we already have / Things we need.

- A module working in production
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Wrap it in an app with the specifications of a _Developer Hub module_.
  - [ ] Deploy to the _PROS_ ecosystem of the **Developer Hub** using _Registry CLI_
  - [ ] Add new events to request the module in "fullscreen" or trigger the "Popup"
- A module currently using our services
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Add in the `setup.json` the services configuration and include all the services used by the module according to the convention
  - [ ] Migrate services to what we call _Smart Services_.
- A module using labels defined in the system
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Make an inventory of all the label keys used by the Module.
  - [ ] Add the i18n configuration to `setup.json` and include all the labels keys that the module has with their respective values ​​in English.
- A module using **required settings** to be functional and flexible
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Add to `setup.json` the configuration to use custom settings
  - [ ] Define the structure of the module settings using the generic settings templates provided
  - [ ] Connect the new settings values ​​received through the _Module Payload_ with the way the module internally handles the settings.
- A module using styling mechanisms that apply Design System (formerly EDS)
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Add to `setup.json` the configuration to use _Design System_ style tokens.
  - [ ] Make the necessary mapping transformations between the received _Design System_ tokens and the internal token structure used by the module.
- A module using our tracking services
  - **What we need?**
  - [ ] Migrate to the new module tracking library.

## Straight to the point

<Steps>

### Obtaining credentials

Before being able to interact with the platform you need to have available certain credentials necessary to deploy the module and also to interact with the services/apis.

- Registry CLI credentials (user, key).
- Services/Apis token.

<Callout>
  There is no reason to stop if you do not yet have the final Registry CLI credentials. You can advance in everything else except what is related to module deployment/promotion.
</Callout>

### Wrap module in a Registry module

At this point you should have code for a functional module (usually as a component in _React_) but that has not yet been integrated into the **Developer Hub Ecosystem**.

What we will do in this step is wrap that module in an application that has the requirements to be rendered as a _Developer Hub Module_.

Assuming that the module you already have is developed in _React_, and taking into account the previously mentioned requirements that make any project a _Developer Hub Module_, we recommend that to start getting familiar with the ecosystem you try using one of our `hello-react` created with _Vite_ (Later you can create your own projects with your own tools optimized to your needs.):

```bash
npx degit Everymundo/developer-hub/examples/hello-react your-project-folder-name
```

<Callout>
  The following link shows a production-ready module in the Playground: https://everymundo.github.io/developer-hub/playground/?url=https://modules.everymundo.work/prod/FRONT10/FRONT10-001/20240425194647/index.html
</Callout>

#### Project structure

By executing the above command you will get a web application with the following structure. This application already meets the requirements to be considered a _Developer Hub Module_.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="hello-react/" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public/" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="setup.json" active />
      <FileTree.File name="..." />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src/" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="components/" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="App/" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="App.css" />
          <FileTree.File name="App.jsx" active />
          <FileTree.File name="index.js" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
        <FileTree.Folder name="Button/" />
        <FileTree.File name="..." />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="context/" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="hooks/" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="styles/" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="utils/" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.js" active />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="package.json" active />
    <FileTree.File name="..." />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Three files have been highlighted because they are closely associated with the integration with the **Developer Hub Ecosystem** and will be mentioned repeatedly in the following steps of this guide:

- `public/setup.json`
- `package.json`
- `src/index.js`
- `src/components/App/App.jsx`

### Setup.json and Module Payload in practice

Setup.json example:

```json filename="public/setup.json" 
{
  "context": {},

  "settings": {
    "schema": {
      "properties": {
        "title": {
          "title": "Title",
          "description": "Description, lorem ipsum lorem ..",
          "help": "Hint: Text next to a field to guide the end user filling it",
          "placeholder": "Placeholder ..",
          "type": "string",
          "default": "Hello React"
        }
      }
    }
  },

  "styles": {
    "service": "codeless",
    "options": {
      "type": "eds",
      "format": "json"
    }
  },

  "i18n": {
    "rtl": true,
    "language": "*",
    "labels": {
      "label-key-1": "English value for key 1",
      "label-key-2": "English value for key 2"
    }
  },

  "tokens": {
    "em:apiKey": "<some-very-very-secret-token>"
  },

  "services": {
    "some-unique-and-well-known-key": {
      "endpoint": "https://services-url/path-to-services"
    },
    "em:sputnik:search": {
      "endpoint": "https://openair-dev.airtrfx.com/airfare-sputnik-service/v3/%%tenantCode%%/fares/search"
    }
  },

  "metaData": {}
}
```

Payload example

```json
{
  "context": {},
  "settings": {},
  "styles": {
    "value": {}
  },
  "i18n": {
    "labels": {}
  },
  "tokens": {
    "em:apiKey": "<value>"
  },
  "services": {}
}
```

### Using Registry Script in `index.js`.

```js filename="src/index.js" {1,9, 11}
import { isReady } from "@everymundo/registry-script";

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

import App from "./components/App";
import getCmpConfig from "./utils/getCmpConfig";

isReady().then(async (payload) => {
  // Transform data received from the payload to what is expected by the module
  const cmpConfig = await getCmpConfig(payload);

  ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
    <App cmpConfig={cmpConfig} />
  );
});
```

```js filename="src/components/App/App.jsx" {13}
import React from "react";

import FcBookingContainer from "@everymundo/em-cmp-lib-airmodules-components/src/components/em-cmp-flights-booking/container/FlightsBooking";
import DynamicContextInterceptor from "@everymundo/em-cmp-lib-airmodules-components/src/components/em-cmp-flights-booking/container/DynamicContextInterceptor";
import ThemeProvider from "@everymundo/em-cmp-lib-airmodules-components/src/atoms/services/theme/context/ThemeProvider";

const Container = ({ children }) => (
  <div style={{ maxWidth: 1200, margin: "auto", minHeight: 600 }}>
    {children}
  </div>
);

const App = ({ cmpConfig }) => (
  <Container>
    <ThemeProvider theme={cmpConfig.theme} loadTailwind={true}>
      <DynamicContextInterceptor>
        <FcBookingContainer cmpConfig={cmpConfig} />
      </DynamicContextInterceptor>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </Container>
);

export default App;
```

### Special events: "Fullscreen" and "Popup".

(Explanation of the new event names and how to use them with promises.)

### Settings definition (Form)

The convention for defining module settings is based on [Json Schema](https://json-schema.org/) with some [minor tweaks specific to the **Developer Hub**](/learning/setup-file/settings). 

Use the following real example of a module in production as a starting point for creating the `Setup.json` of your new module. The following link opens the `Setup.json` of that module in the _Editor_ (Add or remove to suit module needs):

https://everymundo.github.io/developer-hub/editor/?setup=https://modules.everymundo.work/prod/FRONT10/FRONT10-001/20240425194647/setup.json

### Consuming EDS

(Describe where the tokens are received, the structure of the object, how to print the sources and list of all the tokens.)

### I18N / Label Translation

(Brief description of some attributes of i18n and how to extract the module labels.)

### Migration of Services/APIS

(How services are defined in Setup.json and how to migrate to new versions.)

### Tracking library

(Link to the tracking library.)

### Deploy new module using Registry CLI
