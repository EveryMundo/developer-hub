## Knowing the "mamotreto" / Get Started.

This is a detailed guide to accelerate the migration of existing PROS modules to the Registry Ecosystem. It serves as a complement to other tools for organizing internal processes.

It will be useful as long as the modules meet these conditions::

- The module to be migrated is already working in production. 
- The module currently uses our Services/APIS (although not necessarily the latest versions) 
- The module already has all the labels defined in the system. 
- The module has styling mechanisms that allow it to look as desired in our system and partially implements EDS even if it is not directly connected to a theme. 
- The module has all the necessary settings to be functional and flexible according to our needs.
