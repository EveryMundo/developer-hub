# Tracking Migration Guide

![Tracking Migration Guide Cover](@/assets/images/migration-guide/cover.jpg)

## Get Started

This is a simple guide to migrate the way you use tracking in existing modules of the **Developer Hub Ecosystem**.

### Existing processes/disadvantages

Currently modules use the _Tracking Package_, but this mechanism in the context of the **Developer Hub Ecosystem** modules brings a series of disadvantages listed below and we want to simplify this process.

- The _Tracking Package_ is a library that must be imported and used directly by the module, which increases the size of the bundle, when in many cases the module does not need to activate tracking.
- The _Tracking Package_ currently has in its code, and by design, configurations of the available tenants and each time a tenant is added an update of the library is needed.
- The _Tracking Package_ currently uses microservices endpoints and has saved an `API Key` within the code for this. If this `API Key` expires, all modules would have to be massively updated, causing new deployments.
- The _Tracking Package_ currently follows frequent update cycles which would cause unnecessary module deployments.
- Currently the responsibility of installing/importing/updating the _Tracking Library_ is assumed by the partners and it should not be that way.
- Currently it is a bit complicated to do QA when using _Tracking Package_ by modules.

For these reasons we have been looking for alternative solutions that reduce all these problems and also simplify the ease of QA reviews.

### Alternative proposal

Since all modules, regardless of the technology in which their code is developed (say React, Angular, Vue...), must import **Registry Script** by obligation, we have developed a solution in which the call to the tracking events is the responsibility of that **Registry Script** library.

For this purpose, a new function `trackEvent` has been created, whose implementation is basically an empty code that receives the `eventObject` that have been defined when using the _Tracking Package_. It would no longer be necessary to import or install the _Tracking Package_, just use this new function defined in **Registry Script**.

This new function would be practically empty code by definition. Its job is to redirect calls to the _Tracking Package_, and this would only work when the tracking resources are dynamically inserted into the Iframe and for a tenant/module combination. This dynamic insertion would be done by the platform and would be outside the partner context. We repeat: it will no longer be necessary to import/install the _Tracking Package_.

Advantages:

- The module's bundle size is reduced, it no longer needs the Tracking Package.
- The partner does not need to take responsibility for installing/importing/updating the Tracking Package.
- Tracking resources will be dynamically inserted by the platform in situations where they are needed.
- The need for frequent updates to modules and deployments related to updates to the Tracking Package is no longer necessary.
- Improved ability to do QA reviews to the tracking system: Now visible in the Playground

A detailed explanation with examples and the steps required to perform the migration will be explored in the next section.

<Callout>
  In this guide, **Developer Hub** and **Registry** are used to refer to the same concept.

## Concepts/Some examples

Industries

- Airlines: `flights`
- Hospitality: `hospitality`
- Events: `events`


Current invocation of tracking by the Registry modules

```js
import formatter from '@everymundo/airmodules-event-datalayer';

// For Vertical Airlines
formatter.formatAirlines(eventObject);

// For Vertical Hospitality
formatter.formatHotels(eventObject);

// For Vertical Events
formatter.formatEvents(eventObject);
```

New tracking invocation by Registry modules

```js
import { trackEvent } from '@everymundo/registry-script'

// For Vertical Airlines
trackEvent('flights', eventObject);

// For Vertical Hospitality
trackEvent('hospitality', eventObject);

// For Vertical Events
trackEvent('events', eventObject);
```

<Callout>
  The `eventObject` remains the same as before
</Callout>

## Migration step by step

<Steps>

### Update **Registry Script** to `v0.6.0` or higher


### Remove Tracking Package


### Update the function call to fire the tracking event


</Steps>
